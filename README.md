Accurate Fish Detection and Species Identification:
- The model is equipped with advanced object detectioncapabilities using the YOLOv8 architecture.
- It can reliably detect individual fish in real-time video feeds,regardless of their position, orientation, or movement.
- Additionally, the model identifies the specific species of each detected fish by associating their features with the predefined classes in the training data.
- This enables detailed monitoring of the tank or pond's aquatic population.
  
• Real-Time Fish Tracking and Total Count Maintenance:
- The model leverages tracking algorithms to assign unique IDs to each detected fish, ensuring accurate tracking across video frames.
- This prevents double-counting the same fish and maintains a consistent and reliable total count of all the fish in the tank or  pond.
  The system dynamically updates the count in real-time, even as fish enter or exit the camera's field of view, ensuring a high level of accuracy in population monitoring.
  
• Alert System for Abnormal Fish Count:
- The system is programmed to monitor the total fish count and compare it with predefined thresholds.
- If the fish count falls below or exceeds the expected range, the model immediately triggers an alert on SMS.
- Such anomalies could indicate potential issues like fish escaping, dying, or overcrowding, enabling timely intervention to maintain the health and safety of the aquatic environment.
  
• Digital Geofencing-Based Oxygen Level Alerts on SMS:
- The model employs geofencing technology to analyze fish behavior and detect potential signs of low oxygen levels in the Tank or pond.
- A geofence is defined as a virtual boundary within the video feed, often set near the surface of the water.
- Fish behavior, such as frequent and prolonged swimming near the geofence, is used as an indicator of low oxygen levels, as fish often surface in such conditions.
- When such behavior is detected, the system triggers an alert on SMS to inform caretakers of the potential issue, allowing them to take corrective actions, such as increasing aeration or performing water quality checks.

- CONCLUSION
• Fish Detection and Species Identification:
- The model successfully detects fish in the video feed and accurately identifies their species.
- It can handle multiple fish species simultaneously and classify them based on the dataset used for training.
  
• Fish Tracking and Total Count Monitoring:
- The model assigns a unique ID to each fish and tracks them across frames, maintaining a consistent count even as fish move within the frame.
- This allows the system to provide a real-time total count and separate count for each species of the fishes in the tank.
  
• Alert System for Unusual Fish Count:
- The system monitors the total fish count and triggers alert on SMS when the count falls below or exceeds expected thresholds.
- This feature is essential for detecting issues like fish escaping, deaths, or overcrowding, helping maintain the tank's balance.
  
• Low Oxygen Level Alerts via Geofencing:
- By implementing digital geofencing, the model monitors fish behavior, specifically detecting when fish congregate near the water's surface—a behavior commonly associated with low
oxygen levels.
- When such behavior is detected, the system generates an alert on SMS to notify the user, enabling timely intervention to address oxygen deficiencies
